    <h3>Welcome to my new website!</h3>

        My website has received a complete rewrite, it is now easier to navigate, loads faster and works better on old browsers. <br>
        I have also improved in accessibility, all images now have a "alt" tag and screenreaders are now able to describe these.
        <br><br>
        Another motivation was that the old website didnÂ´t work properly on older browsers like Edge 15 on Windows 10 Mobile or Internet Explorer, and since many of you are using this website on these webbrowsers, I had to change something about it.
        <br><br>
        Just like on the old website, you are able to download various apps.
        <br>
        But there is also something new, I now have a blog ðŸŽ‰
        <br><br>
        I am going to post news about this website, new app releases and various other projects from time to time.
        <br><br>
        I hope you have a nice day and enjoy my new website!
